Simple python implementation of Nova: Recursive Zero-Knowledge Arguments from Folding Schemes

# Installation
Then, run `poetry install` in the root of the repository. This will install all the dependencies in a virtualenv.

# Usage

## construction 2 in the paper
test the basic folding scheme for r1cs, it takes about 25 s to run one fold(it's a bit slow right now).
```shell
cd src
poetry run python3 r1cs.py 
```
